# Building RESTful APIs Using Node.js and Express Course

This course Helped Me Build and document REST APIs using Vanilla and Express.js, Secure the REST API using JWT and Oauth.

For newly emerged technologies, REST APIs offer a flexible, lightweight process to integrate applications. These API's have emerged as the most common method used for connecting components of the distributed system. For a backend developer building REST APIs is one of the basic requirements. The skills acquired in this learning sprint will enable you to build REST APIs using Vanilla JS.

ExpressJS is one of the best backend development JavaScript Framework. It is primarily used of creating Restful APIâ€™s that accept request from frontend and send appropriate responses. With ExpressJS you will be able to scale your application quickly. This learning sprint will enable you to build REST APIs using Express JS and document the REST API using tools like Swagger.

Every day millions of users put out sensitive information on the internet. Keeping this information safe is one of the biggest challenges faced by the developers. For a developer, it is crucial to build secure applications. It is important to secure REST API with basic authentication using JWT or JSON Web Tokens. In this learning sprint, you will learn to authorize applications with external APIs using OAUTH2.
